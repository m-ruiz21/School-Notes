The parts came in today and I went to go pick them up. 
One of the parts did not come out as we would have liked, but the rapid prototyping studio is asking for me to submit another request, but I'd rather get the FEDC stuff done and just sent it to print there while we test what we can.

Today we tested the parts that we were able to create, and what we have with for the prototype seems to work so that's exciting.

I've officially sent the team request in to be able to preprint the things we need.

Met up today to try to figure some things out before Thursday.

Helped out the software team and tried to set some goals. 
We made the decision that 3D printing takes ridiculously long and we need to meet up in the weekend and just finish the rest of it with an easily manufactured / modified material like wood.
