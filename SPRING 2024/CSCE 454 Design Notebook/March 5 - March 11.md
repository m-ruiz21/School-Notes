\[ 03/05/24 \]

I am feeling awfully sick and I got an excused absence for the entire week.

I am kind of hoping the team makes progress while I am gone, but in the meantime I just finished my FEDC membership quiz and am waiting for the email back.

\[ 03/07/24 \]

I am still stick, but in the meantime I was able to successfully send a request to the MEEN rapid prototyping studio while my FEDC membership gets completed. 

It's set to be completed during spring break. 

On the other hand, my membership came in, but I cannot send anything to print without a team account. 

And in order to have a team account, I need my entire team to be members, so I am going to task them with that over spring break along with whatever else they need to finish.
