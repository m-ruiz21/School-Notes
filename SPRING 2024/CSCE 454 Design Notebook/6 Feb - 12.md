Thinking about the POC (Proof Of Concept) and general direction of the project:
- Just needs to do obstacle avoidance in the beginning. 
	- If there's a human in front, avoid it.
	- If there's an obstacle, correct course
- We can focus on smarter navigation later, especially with human guidance / tugging

A few people can work on this obstacle avoidance POC while maybe some people work on the LIDAR smart navigation? 

I think in the beginning I think it's important to have a POC with LIDAR, maybe a simple camera, and then we can add a depth camera beyond that if we find it necessary.

Single camera + ultrasonic for cheapest results?? Don't need to overcomplicated, let's try it with this and see if we need more utility later.

Turtle bot 3 looks like is an open source project we can use for initial guidance.

Will probably have to use Gazebo + ROS for initial prototyping
