This was the first time back since we divided up teams, so this time around we gave our updates to what was done.

The mechanical team is unfortunately held back due to the natural restrictions of using physical components, but a plan of action was set.

We're currently looking at more concrete solutions for the drive train as well as designs we might like for the wheel.

We found some of the 3D printed wheel solutions we saw as well as found a concrete design for the drive train. We're currently considering buying both the drive train and the 3D printed wheel, however it's going to be important to consider the compatibility issues with any components we do end up buying.

So today, we viewed the solutions for the drive train and concluded that the drive train compatibility issues are too large. 

Thus, we decided that the drivetrain should be 3D printed and created using some sort of CAD software. 

However, we want to limit the amount of that we're 3D printing since we need to send those out to the FEDC for them to print and that takes a lot of time. 

Because of that, we've decided to simply buy the wheel from a local hardware store and build the drive train to fit the wheels we do end up buying.

Today, we ended up buying the wheel as well as created the models needed to construct the drive train.

I am hoping I can get my FEDC certification done so I can finally send those 3D printing requests.
