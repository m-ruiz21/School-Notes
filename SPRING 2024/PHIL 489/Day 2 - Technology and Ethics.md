We can look at Technology as artifacts
## Postphenomenology:
Postphenomenology is *the investigation of global culture and technology or "artifacts".*

Within it, there's a framework called Mediation theory.
**Mediation theory:** 
	- Rather approaching technologies as material objects opposed to human subjects, or as mere extensions of human beings, it sees them as mediators of human-world relations.
	- Focuses on how it changes our :
		- experiences / perceptions of the world (and thus our change in expectations in our world)
		- actions in the world (and the addition / subtraction of skills through adaptation in the "new" world)

## Epistemology
Technology provides quantitative data about the world, thus it is also important to understand epistemology in order to understand its impact.

Epistemology *is the theory of knowledge.* It studies:
- correspondence of our ideas with the world
- coherence of ideas
