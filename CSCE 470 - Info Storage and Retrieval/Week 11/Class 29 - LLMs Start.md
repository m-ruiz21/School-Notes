# The plan going forward

- Intro to LLMs
- Looking at the origins of language models.
- Previous how LLMs can help us in search and recommendation.

# Current state of LLMs

Currently we can use LLMs for:
- Simple factoid queries
- Complex and more abstract queries
- Creative outputs like poems.
- Summarization.
- Code understanding.
- Code writing.

**But can we make it recommend?**

# Defining LLMs

First off, what are LLMs?

> Large language models (LLMs) refer to  Transformer language models that contain hundreds of billions (or more) of parameters, which are trained on massive text data. LLMs  exhibit strong capacities to understand natural  language and solve complex tasks (via text generation).

## What is a Transformer?

A transformer is a deep learning architecture proposed in 2017 that relies on the parallel multi-head attention mechanism.

It's the newest and most revolutionary step in Large Language Models.

Before we go in depth, let's back up a bit.

Back in the day, whenever we searched up on google, we wouldn't always get a definitive answer, it would give us URLs.
