Ethics is the study of what is right or wrong.
So what is good to the state of affairs, meaning: 
- people
- society

**Virtue Ethics**
- the study of what it means to flourish, to live well, as a human and for humanity in general.
- Asks, what character traits should I develop? i.e. courage, moderation, prudence, justice, etc.

**Utilitarianism** 
An ethical theory that states that an *act* is right if and only if there is no other possible act that will lead to better **consequences** for everybody.

The question of what consequences we should consider can be divided into the following schools of thought:
- Hedonistic (what generates the most pleasure / removes the most pain?)
- Preference Satisfaction.
- Objective list of universal goods for people.

**Duty / Kantian Ethics**
- Non consequentialist ethical idea.
- The rightness of an act depends on whether it aligns with duty.
- Duty is a moral obligation that arises among rational persons.
- Can my motive be rationalized?
- Am I treating all persons with respect, as more than mere means
- Am I respecting others moral autonomy?

**Thin vs Thick Ethics:** 
- Thin ethics: universal moral obligations.
- Thick ethics: culturally or context. There's specific obligations.
